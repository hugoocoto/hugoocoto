## Experience

Full-time senior developer and group leader at my parent's coutch (2021 -
now). Used to program while watching TV and / or talking with people so I feel
like a strong programmer as I never missed a single semicolon.

## Motivation

I program because I enjoy it, since if money or fame were my motivation, I would have quit a long time ago.


> Most developers I know write code for money or fame. They serve corporations or burn hard at startups. There is nothing wrong with it, but it seems that programming for fun is fading away in my peer group. Itâ€™s a shame. -- Vladimir Terekhov
